# Poshmark iOS App Reverse Engineering & Competitive Intelligence Analysis

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the complete deliverables for a take-home reverse engineering assessment focused on the Poshmark iOS application (v9.28). The project successfully deconstructs the application's security, uncovers its private API, and maps its authentication flow. The findings were then used to build a functional competitive intelligence tool that automates data collection and visualizes market trends through an interactive dashboard.

## Workflow & Methodology

The project followed a standard reverse engineering workflow:

1.  **Static Analysis**: The decrypted application package (`.ipa`) was analyzed to understand its structure and identify key classes related to networking and authentication.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis**: Using a jailbroken iPhone and the Frida toolkit, the application was instrumented at runtime. This allowed for bypassing anti-debugging measures and intercepting live network traffic to observe API calls in real-time.
3.  **API & Authentication Mapping**: The intercepted traffic was analyzed to document API endpoints, request/response structures, and the multi-step, challenge-response authentication mechanism.
4.  **Automation & Application**: The gathered intelligence was used to build a Python-based system (`posh.py`) that automates interaction with the discovered API.
5.  **Visualization**: A Streamlit GUI (`posh-gui.py`) was developed to present the collected data in an interactive and actionable format for business analysis.

## üìÇ File Legend & Repository Structure

This project is organized into three main categories: reports, scripts, and data outputs.

### üìú Reports & Documentation

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `REPORT-Final.pdf` | The primary, high-level summary report. It details the project's objectives, methodology, tools used, key findings, and final recommendations. |
| `LOGIN.pdf` | A detailed, technical breakdown of the Poshmark API's challenge-response authentication mechanism. It explains why simple credential submission fails and details the role of device integrity checks. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Scripts & Code

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `startTracingNetwork.sh` | A simple shell script to execute the Frida sniffer and save its output to `poshmark_analysis.txt`. |
| `poshmark_sniffer.js` | The core **Frida script** used for dynamic analysis. It hooks into the Poshmark application at runtime to bypass anti-debugging measures and intercept network traffic, authentication tokens, and API calls. |
| `login.py` | A Python script that demonstrates the multi-step, challenge-response login flow. It is intended to fail to prove the effectiveness of the app's security. |
| `posh.py` | The main **Python script** for competitive intelligence. It uses the credentials and endpoints discovered during the analysis to automate product searches and aggregate pricing data. |
| `posh-gui.py` | A **Streamlit dashboard application** that provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the competitive intelligence data gathered by `posh.py`. |

### üìä Data & Output Files

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `poshmark_analysis.txt` | The **raw log output** generated by the `poshmark_sniffer.js` Frida script. It contains a real-time log of all intercepted network requests, headers, authentication tokens, and JSON responses. |
| `python-output.txt` | The **console output** from running the `posh.py` script. It shows the script's progress as it analyzes different product categories and generates the final intelligence report. |
| `poshmark_intelligence_20250807_2052.json` | A **sample JSON export** of the structured data collected by the competitive intelligence script. This file demonstrates the schema of the gathered product and market analysis data. |

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1\. Dynamic Analysis (Frida)

  * **Prerequisites**: A jailbroken iOS device, Frida server running on the device, and Frida tools installed on your computer.
  * **Execution**:
    ```bash
    ./startTracingNetwork.sh
    ```
    This will attach Frida to the Poshmark app and log all network activity to `poshmark_analysis.txt`.

### 2\. Competitive Intelligence Script (Python)

  * **Prerequisites**: Python 3.x and the `requests` library.
  * **Execution**:
    ```bash
    python posh.py
    ```
    This will run the automated analysis and print a summary report to the console.

### 3\. Intelligence Dashboard (Streamlit)

  * **Prerequisites**: Python 3.x and libraries listed in a `requirements.txt` file (e.g., `streamlit`, `pandas`, `plotly`).
  * **Execution**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run posh-gui.py
    ```
    This will launch a local web server with an interactive dashboard to explore the collected data.
